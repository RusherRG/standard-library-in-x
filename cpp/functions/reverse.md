## Declaration

```cpp
reverse(iterator for start of the range,iterator for end of the range which is not included in range);
```

## Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  int numbers[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8};

  cout<<"Before Reversing:"<<endl;  
  for(int i =0;i<8;i++)
      cout<<numbers[i]<<" ";

  cout<<endl<<endl;

  reverse(numbers, numbers+8);

  cout<<"After Reversing:"<<endl;
  for(int i =0;i<8;i++)
      cout<<numbers[i]<<" ";

  cout<<endl;

    return 0;
}
```

## Output

```
Before Reversing:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

After Reversing:
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
```
